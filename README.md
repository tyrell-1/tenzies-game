# Tenzies Game

This project is a simple implementation of the Tenzies game, built as part of following a [freeCodeCamp React tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4rFhThSX04). The game allows players to roll dice and freeze their values until all dice match a target number. The project focuses on utilizing React concepts, state management, and animations.

## Overview

**Tenzies** is a dice game where the objective is to roll until all dice show the same value. Players can "freeze" specific dice between rolls to retain their values. The project uses React for stateful components and the `motion` library for animations.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the UI and managing state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components.
- **Motion**: For animations and interactive effects.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language.
